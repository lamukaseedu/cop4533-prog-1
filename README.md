Instructions: clone repo into an empty working directory, run matcher and verifier in IDE or in terminal with no arguments
```
cd src
python matcher.py
python verifier.py
```

Edit example.in and example.out as desired before running code, but program assumes that input/output format matches that described on the Canvas assignment page.
